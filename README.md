# excel-timecode

Microsoft Excel custom functions (JavaScript) for working with video timecode standards and wall
time durations.

![Preview of spreadsheet using timecode functions](preview.png)

**IMPORTANT**: These custom functions are only supported in the latest subscription versions of
Office for Windows, Mac, or the web (NOT in one-time purchase versions of Office 2019 or earlier).

Designed for film & television composers, though these may be useful for anyone who works with
timecode values in Microsoft Excel.

# Use in your own spreadsheets

**TODO**: Share Excel Spreadsheet templates for Music Log and Spotting that use these functions.

## TEMPORARY Installation Instructions

**NOTE**: Currently in the process of publishing this project to
[AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/), which will greatly simplify the end user
installation complexity here. In the meantime, you'll have to do some extra work (this process is
based on
[these Microsoft instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/publish/host-an-office-add-in-on-microsoft-azure).

### Excel for Windows

1. Open Windows Explorer (`âŠž Win + E`)
1. Within the left panel, click your `C:` disk under *This PC*
1. Create a new folder directly under the `C:` drive (**Right Click > New > Folder**), and name the new folder `OfficeAddIns`
1. On the newly created folder, **Right Click > Give access to > Specific people...**
1. Select `Everyone` from the dropdown box and click **Add**
1. Press **Share** button. Make a note of the path that begins with `\\` under `OfficeAddIns` (for example, `\\YOUR-PC-NAME\OfficeAddIns`)
1. Open [manifest.xml](manifest.xml) and press the **Raw** button
1. Save the contents of this file to your computer as `C:\OfficeAddIns\ExcelTimecode.xml`
1. (Make sure your browser didn't really save it with an extra `.txt` extension as `ExcelTimecode.xml.txt`)
1. Open Excel
1. Go to **File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings...**
1. Select **Trusted Add-in Catalogs** on the left
1. Enter the shared folder path (for example, `\\YOUR-PC-NAME\OfficeAddIns`) in the input box next to Catalog URL and press the **Add catalog** button
1. Check the **Show in Menu** box and then click **OK** to close the dialog
1. Click **OK** to close the Options dialog
1. Go the the **Insert** tab in the top ribbon menu and click the **My Add-ins** button
1. Under the *Office Add-ins* title, click the text that says **SHARED FOLDER**
1. Click **excel-timecode** and press **Add**

If successful, you should see a Timecode section all the way to the right of the **Home** tab in the top ribbon, and all these custom functions will now be available.

### Excel for Mac

**TODO**: Document how to do this.

# Using custom functions
The last 2 arguments to every function below are `frameRate` and `dropType` values.

Data validation list of supported `frameRate` values (see templates above for example usage):
```
23.976,24.000,25.000,29.970,30.000,47.952,48.000,50.000,59.940,60.000
```
**IMPORTANT**: The `frameRate` value must be **Plain text** type (not a number) and include exactly
2 or 3 decimal digits after a period. This is to avoid any possible confusion over *e.g.* whether
`24` means `23.976` or `24.000`.

Data validation list of `dropType` values (see templates above for example usage):
```
non-drop,drop
```

## Most common functions
```JavaScript
=TIMECODE.TC_TO_WALL_SECS("00:00:01:02", "50.00", "non-drop")
```
- Yields `1.04` secs (true seconds of wall time measured from `00:00:00:00`).

```JavaScript
=TIMECODE.WALL_SECS_BETWEEN_TCS("00:00:01:03", "00:02:05:11", "24.00", "non-drop")
```
- Yields `124.33333333...` secs (true seconds of wall time between the timecodes).

```JavaScript
=TIMECODE.WALL_SECS_TO_DURSTR(3765)
```
- Yields `"1h 02m 45s"` (a human-readable duration string). Rounds to nearest second.

```JavaScript
=TIMECODE.WALL_SECS_TO_TC_LEFT(1.041, "50.00", "non-drop")
```
- Yields `"00:00:01:02"`, the timecode of the closest frame that is exactly at or
before (*i.e.* to the left of) the given `wallSecs` value of `1.041` (true seconds of
wall time measured from `00:00:00:00`).

```JavaScript
=TIMECODE.WALL_SECS_TO_TC_RIGHT(1.041, "50.00", "non-drop")
```
- Yields `"00:00:01:03"`, the timecode of the closest frame that is exactly at or
after (*i.e.* to the right of) the given `wallSecs` value of `1.041` (true seconds of
wall time measured from `00:00:00:00`).

## Other functions (more advanced)
```JavaScript
=TIMECODE.TC_ERROR("01:02:03:04", "23.976", "non-drop")
```
- Yields an error string if timecode (or format) is invalid, or an empty string otherwise.

```JavaScript
=TIMECODE.TC_TO_FRAMEIDX("00:00:01:02", "50.00", "non-drop")
```
- Yields `52` (the timecode refers to the 53rd frame of video, counting from `00:00:00:00` as
index 0). Dropped frames are not given index values (so in 29.97 drop, `00:00:59:29` has index
`1799` and `00:01:00:02` has index `1800`).

```JavaScript
=TIMECODE.FRAMEIDX_TO_TC(52, "50.00", "non-drop")
```
- Yields `"00:00:01:02"`, the timecode of the given frame index.

```JavaScript
=TIMECODE.FRAMEIDX_TO_WALL_SECS(52, "50.00", "non-drop")
```
- Yields `1.04` secs (true seconds of wall time measured from `00:00:00:00`).

```JavaScript
=TIMECODE.WALL_SECS_TO_FRAMEIDX_LEFT(1.041, "50.00", "non-drop")
```
- Yields `52`, the frame index of the closest frame that is exactly at or
before (*i.e.* to the left of) the given `wallSecs` value of `1.041` (true seconds of
wall time measured from `00:00:00:00`).

```JavaScript
=TIMECODE.WALL_SECS_TO_FRAMEIDX_RIGHT(1.041, "50.00", "non-drop")
```
- Yields `53`, the frame index of the closest frame that is exactly at or
after (*i.e.* to the right of) the given `wallSecs` value of `1.041` (true seconds of
wall time measured from `00:00:00:00`).
